# OMOP-OPS-SNOMED-map-eval
This project contains all implementation relevant software code, used for a research work that aims to evaluate the coverage of the OPS vocabulary and its SNOMED mappings based on real world procedure data. 

It consists of two files:
1. SQL script to export needed data on OPS vocaulary, the mapping and the related real world data elements from an OMOP database
2. Python script that contains the data analyis for the previosly exported data from OMOP

More documentation is given directly in the scripts.
